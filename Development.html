                            demand so much that the Earth has to provide enough to sustain them 
                            for the use of us humans. The extent of this leads to great damage 
                            on Earth, and takes up valuable time for cleaning and manufacturing the 
                            type of fuel as a few examples.

                            Electric cars are useful, yet demand huge amounts of electricity. Hydrogen 
                            cars, those need certain refined fuel in order to run properly. What we
                            need is a device that gives back to the Earth, not just taking away from 
                            it. This will rely on a certain solution(lithium hydroxide) in order to
                            achieve our goals. There will be no other requirement aside from the 
                            product and the given solution for a greater simplicity.
